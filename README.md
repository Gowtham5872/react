# Todo App

## Overview
This project is a Todo application built with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Users can create todo tasks with a task name, description, and status. By default, the status is set to "not completed" for newly created todos. The app allows users to edit and delete existing todos. Users can also change the status of a todo by clicking on it, which will display a dropdown menu to select either "completed" or "not completed".
